0.34a (2007-03-27)
  * PC: Fixed hidden level in Next at right mode (0.33 regression).
  * DS: Fixed hidden sprites due to bug in devkitARM R20 libnds
    (0.34 regression).
  * DS: New touch screen code should eliminate erroneous low notes
    played upon pen-up.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.34 (2007-03-23)
  * Fixed Move to Back piece set (0.14 regression: dang!).
  * Separate options for number of previewed pieces above shadow and
    outside field (requested by kiwibonga, caffeine, and Cubicz).
  * Option to disable IRS (requested by DIGITAL).
  * Garbage gimmicks (vs., drill 40, hr derby) replaced with new
    garbage option (requested by Cubicz).
  * In garbage style "Vs.", player can choose difficulty 1 through 4
    (requested by Caithness).
  * Option for line clear delay, independent of entry delay
    (requested by kiwibonga).
  * Garbage style Drill no longer automatically tops out on
    short playfields.
  * Garbage style Vs. generates garbage with SZSZ randomizer.
  * Frequency of Vs. w/Items bananas is independent of randomizer.
  * Fixed self-clearing garbage (0.33 regression).
  * GBA/DS: Fixed pause button hiding left and right walls
    (0.33 regression).
  * GBA/DS: R button also works as hold piece (requested by
    PetitPrince).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.33 (2007-03-08)
  * New speed curve Rhythm Zero is identical to Rhythm except it
    operates at 0G instead of 20G (requested by Cubicz and caffeine).
  * Speed curves that do not use level reset level to 0.
    Therefore, playing a game of Death then a game of Exponential
    on GBA/DS no longer shows the level that the player finished
    Death on as the level during Exponential.
  * Maximum well width increased to 12 (requested by Zed0).
  * Hold piece does not reset floor kicks, lock delay time in entry
    reset, or Rhythm's placement timer.
  * GBA/DS: More shared code moved to file "ljgbads.inc".
  * PC: Stops end-of-section sound when game is over
    (requested by Bloodstar).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.32a (2007-02-25)
  * PC: Fixed demo recording (0.32 regression; reported by Rosti LFC)
  * PC: Option to record all games from the start
    (requested by cdsboy, DIGITAL, Cubicz, and colour_thief).
  * PC: Added Play .ljm gimmick:
    Allegro file selector pops up, and the player can choose the
    filename of a demo to play back (requested by Lardarse).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.32 (2007-02-13)
  * Changed a CPU yield behavior that was affecting battery
    efficiency on the GBA and DS front ends (reported by Mighty Max).
  * Removed Low Rider gimmick in favor of option for well height
    (requested by Matthew).
  * Option for well width, like Shimizu's Tetris Semipro-68k.
    Combine this with a low well height to simulate BIG mode of
    TGM and Heboris (requested by Matthew).
  * Options for entry delay and sideways delay have "max" added to
    their description to clarify things (requested by kotetsu213 and
    Ezzelin).
  * All speed options given in Hz or G are given in both.
  * PC: Next above shadow works in all playfield positions (reported
    by caffeine).
  * GBA/DS: Added option for soft drop speed (requested by Ezzelin).
  * GBA/DS: Some shared code moved to file "ljgbads.inc".
  * GBA/DS: Unavailable hold piece is grayed out.
  * GBA/DS: Lock delay = no lock works (reported by Ezzelin).
  * GBA/DS: Fixed frames/ms display of delays (reported by Ezzelin).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.31 (2007-02-03)
  * Draws the score and next pieces before blitting the playfield
    in case a front-end draws the score or next pieces inside the
    playfield.
  * In Baboo!, speed curve Zero sets the level to the number of
    keypresses so far.
  * PC, GBA: Plays sound effect for end of section in speed curves
    that use sections (Master, Death, NES, Game Boy).
  * PC: Option to draw next pieces inside the playfield, above the
    shadow (requested by caffeine, cdsboy, and Cubicz).
  * GBA, DS: Blocks within a piece are drawn connected once they lock
    (TOD parity, requested by Lardarse and Bloodstar).
  * GBA, DS: Baboo! no longer double-counts console buttons passed
    through the joypad reading code.
  * README: "color=image" clone-and-hack error fixed (reported by
    Bloodstar).
  * README: Explains black rectangle in upper left corner as an
    icon for stop (requested by herc).
  * README: Explains controls on GBA and DS.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.30 (2007-02-01)
  * Fixed ARE display in debrief, which could cause a crash in some
    situations (0.26 regression?).
  * Garbage no longer self-clears in Cascade gravity (reported by
    Bloodstar).
  * In high gravity, land a T with one block over an overhang and
    rotate it once so that it falls and clears a line.  This is no
    longer counted as a T-spin.
  * During a replay, counts keypresses by the replay player.
  * PC: Scales undersized background images to the size of the window
    (requested by Bloodstar).
  * PC: If a piece enters during a skipped frame, a second upward
    trail is no longer drawn (reported by Bloodstar and caffeine).
  * PC: "Next at top" layout draws speedometer (requested by
    matt_hatter83).
  * PC: Trails option is saved properly (reported by caffeine).
  * PC: User can customize the game's text and background colors
    using skin.ini (requested by Bloodstar).
  * Added rudimentary port to Nintendo DS for people with MAX Media
    Dock, M3 Pro, SuperCard Rumble, or SLOT-1 cards, which can run
    DS homebrew but not GBA homebrew.
  * Moscow Nights removed from lj-contrib due to research into the
    copyright term extensions enacted by Russian Federation during
    the 1990s.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.29 (2007-01-17)
  * TDS scoring recognizes chains properly (reported by Lardarse).
  * TDS scoring section factor stops increasing after 190 lines.
  * Added NES scoring method.
  * Added scoring for soft and hard drops to options and debrief.
  * Cascade no longer deletes the bottom row when lines high on the
    playfield are cleared (reported by Lardarse).
  * PC: Draws trails when a tetromino goes up or down rapidly.
    (Option to turn them off.)
  * PC: Handles dirty rectangles for next pieces and score
    separately.
  * Scoring section of README describes all scoring methods.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.28 (2007-01-04)
  * Added Cascade gravity, as seen in Quadra, Tetris Worlds Cascade,
    and Tetris DS Touch.
  * Master/Death: Level starts at -1, so that the first piece is
    played at level 0 (requested by Lardarse).
  * Changed T-spin detection to save whether or not a rotation
    involved a kick (0: move; 1: rotate; 2: rotate with kick) so
    that scoring methods such as TDS can score T-spins with and
    without kicks differently.
  * Added TDS scoring method (line clears only).
  * New, more general, possibly easier to understand reshuffle code
    in bag randomizer (requested by Lardarse)
  * GBA: Gold and silver square colors added (requested by Lardarse).
  * PC: Game over in low ceiling no longer fades the area outside the
    playfield (reported by Lardarse).
  * PC: Close box interrupts starting and game over animations.
  * README warns that 4x4 squares mode needs ljconn.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.27 (2006-12-20)
  * GBA version includes a valid header (requested by Ezzelin).
  * Fixed incorrect spawn orientations for Game Boy rotation system
    (0.25? regression, reported by Lardarse).
  * Fixed incorrect win/loss sound early in 180 seconds (0.25
    regression).
  * New randomizer 10-piece Bag, including the domino and both
    trominoes.
  * GBA version now reports entry and lock delays in both frames
    and milliseconds.
  * Possibly fixed off-by-one in Game Boy speed curve section
    computation, which caused an incorrect slowdown in 210-219
    section (reported by Ezzelin).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.26 (2006-12-15)
  * Option to allow game to proceed in the background (requested by
    Ezzelin).  However, Windows doesn't appear to pass joystick
    presses to the game running in the background.  FCE Ultra has
    what appears to be exactly the same problem.
  * Added Game Boy and NES speed curves.
  * Options and Game Keys are accessed through title screen, not
    gimmick selection.
  * Option to hide playfield without changing the skin.
  * Rearranged rules section of options to correspond more closely to
    the sequence of operations for each tetromino.
  * Soft or hard drop set to "lock on release" no longer produces
    double locks at 20G.
  * Disable initial hard drop when set to "lock" and entry delay is
    greater than 0 but less than DAS delay.
  * Checks for 4x4 squares top to bottom per comparison with The New
    Tetris (N64).
  * Finer grained selections in entry delay (requested by
    matt_hatter83) and lock delay (requested by caffeine).
    They now are at 50ms increments at the low end.
  * Expanded TGM speed curve to 12 sections.  One comparatively slow
    section at 20G was added to Master before Death-equivalent starts
    (now Death 0 is equivalent to Master 600, not 500), and one
    faster section was added to the end of Death based on info posted
    to wiki by colour_thief.
  * Added H.R. Derby gimmick:
    Like Marathon, but every line you clear other than with a
    home run or a T-spin gives you garbage.
  * Ready Go animation is 1.2 seconds, not 2.0 seconds.
  * Preliminary support for Game Boy Advance, with experimental
    paged options replacing scrolling options.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.25 (2006-11-28)
  * Fixed History 6 Rolls deciding between the first piece algorithm
    and the subsequent pieces algorithm (reported by Lardarse).
  * Fixed a signedness issue that broke 180 seconds gimmick in the
    case that a tetromino was kept active between 3:00 and 3:01 (0.24
    regression; reported by caffeine).
  * Allows ending the game with a piece in mid-air (0.24 regression).
  * Removed Arika and renamed Arika+TI to Arika.  For the old
    Arika behavior, set Options:Floor kicks to 0.
  * Options screen allows DAS, allowing future versions to make more
    options and more values for each option available in a less
    cumbersome way.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.24 (2006-11-16)
  * Added Score style to options and debrief.
  * Choice of LJ or TNT64 scoring is based on chosen score style, not
    whether 4x4 squares are turned on.
  * Added Hotline scoring method, where only lines cleared on
    specific rows count toward scoring.  When enabled, draws white
    lines through empty spaces in these rows.
  * New soft drop and hard drop lock setting: Lock on release.  It's
    a spring-loaded system:  When you press the button, it doesn't
    lock, but when you let go, it locks (requested by colour_thief).
  * Option to override lock delay time (requested by caffeine).
  * Option to limit upward kicks (requested by Needle). This may
    obviate the difference between Arika and Arika+TI.
  * Sped up line clear in Master 300-499 to make less of a jarring
    transition to "death" style timings.
  * LJM loading fails even more gracefully on wrong format version,
    properly treating an LJM of the wrong version as not existing.
  * Fixed bug in 0.23's application switch pausing where switching
    away while already paused would require two Esc presses to
    continue (reported by caffeine).
  * Does not stop play until after the line clear animation finishes.
    This allows the game to properly update the single, double,
    triple, etc. counts for the last line that completes the goal
    (0.19 scoring regression?; reported by caffeine).
  * Refactored duplicated option loading code.
  * Options: Ditched parallel struct and array in favor of a
    single list of named indices.
  * Corrected Moscow Nights and Kalinka in lj-contrib for greater
    compatibility with obscure s3m players that can't handle odd
    numbers of channels (requested by Lardarse).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.23 (2006-11-04)
  * Fixed S and Z in Sega 1988.
  * DUMB has been wrapped in a library called LJMusic and can be
    turned off at compile time (edit ljmusic.c and makefile) if you
    don't want to install DUMB.
  * Added support for Xiph.org's OggVorbis codec to LJMusic
    (requested by Needle).
  * Option to ignore sideways movement on first frame (like TGM
    series) (requested by Needle, seconded by caffeine).
  * Properly pauses the game when the player switches away from the
    window (requested by Lardarse).
  * Fails gracefully (does nothing) instead of crashing when loading
    replay files of a different format version.
  * Moved as much as possible below setting display mode so that
    people porting LJ to other platforms can toss up working alert()
    boxes earlier (requested by cdsboy).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.22 (2006-10-23)
  * Fixed color system change after reloading (0.20 regression?,
    reported by lardarse).  Should always unpack options just before
    loading skin.
  * All numbers in saved states are stored big-endian, making movies
    compatible between 0.22 for Windows and Intel Mac and 0.22 for
    PowerPC Mac (requested by cdsboy).
  * Sega rotation systems renamed to Arika for less confusion with
    the rotation systems in Sega's Tetris games from 1988 and 1998
    (requested by Needle).
  * Added Sega 1988 rotation system (like Arika without wall kicks).
  * Preliminary Vorbis playback code is included in the source code
    distribution but has not been activated in the program.
    (The keys to compiling OggVorbis on MinGW+MSYS are 1. set the
    prefix to match the MINGDIR you used to build Allegro, and
    2. disable creation of the shared library.)

_____________________________________________________________________
0.21 (2006-10-21)
  * Added new T-spin detection rule "3-corner T no kick", identical
    to 3-corner T except that a wallkick is not counted as a rotation
    (requested by kotetsu213).
  * Options that don't apply because of how another option is set
    are grayed out with an explanation (requested by Needle).
  * Debrief tells number of blocks left in the playfield and whether
    saved state was used (requested by caffeine).
  * Debrief tells what level the player stopped on.
  * Added support for saving input stream ("demo" or "movie") to file
    "demo.ljm".  Press [ to start/stop recording and ] to start/stop
    playback (requested by caffeine).
  * Pieces are actually random again (0.20 regression).
  * New lockdown mode: Entry reset.  Instead of resetting, the lock
    timer pauses while the piece is falling (requested by caffeine).
  * No +20 for banking more than 5 beats (requested by caffeine).
  * 250 ms entry delay option (requested by matt_hatter83).
  * Entry and sideways delays in Master and Death use the shorter of
    the speed curve's delay and the user's delay.
  * Added soft drop speed to options.
  * Added settings 8.6 Hz through 6.7 Hz to Sideways speed.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.20 (2006-10-15)
  * Fixed color system change after options (0.19 regression).
  * Restored ability to hold first piece (0.17 regression?).
  * Requires down to be re-pressed only when entry delay is less
    than sideways delay.
  * In modes with ARE, allow initial hard drop even on first piece
    (requested by caffeine).
  * Visual refresh in Game Keys.
  * Game Keys ignores keypresses for 1/4 second after each key is
    set, which should fix problems with GameCube to USB adapters
    (requested by Caithness).
  * All platforms use a single randomizer, whose state is associated
    with the playfield.
  * ARE is a binary option again, as several speed curves ignored the
    old version's difference between constant and decreasing.
  * Moved version display to title screen.
  * Sound effect for win differs from that for game over.
  * Sound effect for rotating a piece on its first active frame.
  * Begun to add assertions, causing game over if they fail.
  * Added support for saving the state of the playfield.
    Press [ to save or ] to load.  Movies might be next.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.19 (2006-09-28):
  * Use of SRS or Sega colors is determined by a flag set for each
    rotation system.  The rule is that rotation systems that use
    bounding box rotation should use SRS colors.
  * Added TOD M4 rotation system (face up entry + bounding box
    rotation + roughly TGM style compensation).
  * List items in Options flicker much less.
  * Beginning of an actual title screen.
  * Removed Rhythm gimmick in favor of speed curve option.
  * Added Master and Death speed curves (requested by Needle).
    Death hasn't been tested thoroughly because the developer
    sucks at death.
  * Blits only those playfield rows that have changed, making
    animation smoother on old, cheap, or mobile video cards
    (requested by cosmonaut).
  * Rhythm speed curve no longer has what feels like a big elbow
    (requested by caffeine).  Specifically it gives 20 points
    instead of banking more than 5 pieces' worth of time.
  * Doesn't draw the state after the tetromino spawns but before
    initial rotation has taken effect (requested by Needle).
  * Added sound effect for hold piece (requested by Needle).
  * Land and lock sound much better (requested by Needle).
  * Shuffle columns (seen only in Vs. w/ Items) correctly disconnects
    blocks horizontally.
  * In Square mode, T-spins cause avalanches.
  * In Square mode, lines containing a piece of a 4x4 block are worth
    more, and homers are worth less.
  * Fixed ignoring diagonal presses (0.17 regression).
  * Created a new struct "LJPrefs" to hold preferences set by the
    player in the Options menu separately from the parameters
    that the game actually uses. This allows gimmicks to override
    preferences more cleanly.
  * Added support for future scoring methods where the score per line
    at a given point in the chain is based on a formula.
  * Created a union that combines the new struct with the array that
    the Options menu edits to improve maintainability of Options.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.18 (2006-09-16):
  * Fixed Classic lock reset (unknown regression).
  * Fixed misbehavior when hold is pressed after a piece
    lands but before it locks (0.17 regression).
  * Shadow is drawn using the piece's color, at 25% opacity,
    from rows 4 and 5 of ljblocks.
  * Fixed shadow option saving (0.17a regression).
  * Added option to hide shadow color or change shadow opacity.
  * Split Sega rotation system into one with and one without
    TGM3's upward kicks.
  * Added NES and Game Boy rotation systems.
  * README: Illustration of game play has an image map.  The reader
    can select (hover over) a region of the screenshot, and the
    browser will show the title of the region as a tooltip.
  * BPM is now called speed level in preparation for other
    speed curves (including TGM and TA Death).

_____________________________________________________________________
0.17 (2006-09-13):
  * Option for sticky gravity per color, as seen in The Next Tetris.
  * "Ready, Go" is centered, even in low ceiling gimmicks.
  * Added TGM3's upward kick to Sega T rotations.
  * Added Tengen rotation system.
  * Removed TGM gimmick in favor of entry delay option.
  * Initial hold works at any time.  The key can be pressed and
    released during entry delay or even during line clear delay.
  * Initial actions do not inflate keypress count
    (helpful in Baboo! with entry delay).
  * Draws hold piece in garbage colors when it is not available.
  * Options scroll.
  * Option to draw next pieces to right in constant size or above.
  * Better looking scroll bar in options.
  * Debrief: In naive gravity, reports T-spin singles, doubles,
    and triples separately from non-T-spins.  In other line
    clear gravity modes, "home run" is now called "quad".
  * Fixed a buffer overflow bug in sticky: fillCLoop() no longer
    treats the right side of one row and the left side of the
    row above it as one region.
  * Clarified manual as to the purpose of the Vs. gimmicks.
  * Separated platform specific stuff into a separate struct.
  * Refactored scoring into a separate function for future movement
    to gimmick and option control.
  * Debrief formats the report into a string and then writes it
    to a file and the screen all at once.
  * Refactored play() to move everything in the game loop that is
    not platform specific out of ljpc.c into new file ljplay.c.
  * Wall kick table is no longer flipped, making it easier to add
    new rotation systems.
  * Unified counterclockwise and clockwise rotation code.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.16 (2006-09-03):
  * Fixed instant sideways speed (0.15 regression).
  * In countdown modes, debrief screen displays whether clear was
    successful.
  * 6-piece Bag no longer makes Vs. ridiculously easy.
  * Counts score and garbage separately for future shift to
    gimmick-controlled scoring.
  * Displays score instead of garbage on the play screen.
  * Counts singles, doubles, triples, and homers, and displays them
    in debrief.
  * Option to hide falling piece in addition to shadow.
  * Can load mod, xm, or it music in addition to s3m.
  * Moved skin description from lj.ini to skin.ini, and the name of
    this skin description file name can be changed with the Skin=
    command in lj.ini.
  * Closes lj.ini when reading it.
  * All vkey->action game key handling code moved to macro.c for
    future refactoring.
  * Build process uses automatic generation of C files' dependencies
    for future refactoring of header files.
  * Added two versions of NES-style blocks to lj-contrib:
    one by tepples and one by deepdorp.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.15 (2006-08-27):
  * Options for DAS delay, number of next pieces, and window vs.
    full screen.
  * Options scrolling doesn't cause the dialog's title and
    instructions to flicker.
  * Small font's 5 glyph is the same width as other digits.
  * Fixed O shape table.
  * Macros (vkey->action mappings past the first 8) are in a
    lookup table in the new file macro.c.  This paves the way
    for a future macro editor.
  * Added macros Alt. Firm Drop and Alt. Hold.
  * Game Keys displays names for all keys, not just printable keys.
  * In Sega rotation mode, reads block images from ljblocks-sega.bmp
    and ljconn-sega.bmp if available.
  * If ljbg.jpg is not available, uses a plain white backdrop.
  * Reads file names for block images, background image, and music
    from lj.ini, which the player can edit with a text editor.
  * New "6-piece Bag" randomizer is one stick short of a bundle.
  * Added an arrangement of the minuet from JS Bach's French Suite
    in B minor (BWV 814) to lj-contrib.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.14 (2006-08-18):
  * pause() renamed to pauseGame() to fix namespace collision on
    platforms with unistd.h (Linux, BSD, Mac).
  * Gimmick settings for initial gravity, ARE, and ceiling height
    are initialized from a lookup table.
  * History 6 Rolls randomizer uses correct initial history (ZSZS)
    and correct selection for the first piece (I, J, L, or T).
  * Blocks are drawn connected within each tetromino if ljconn.bmp
    is present.
  * Corrected connection table for O tetromino.
  * Rhythm's BPM counter increases after every 64 beats, not every
    64 tetrominoes.
  * Added Low Vs. gimmick:
    Like Vs. CPU with a low ceiling.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.13 (2006-08-15):
  * Hard drop lock option "Zangi" renamed to "Slide".
  * Added soft drop lock option.
  * Ignores diagonal presses differently: instead of pretending the
    keys are up, it pretends that they haven't changed from the last
    frame.  UP, UP+RIGHT, UP no longer makes a double hard drop.
  * Esc pauses the game and music instead of immediately quitting.
  * Added contributions from cdsboy to lj-contrib.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.12 (2006-08-13):
  * Creates lj.ini if it doesn't exist, instead of crashing on
    startup.
  * Added half-size Aver16 font.
  * Zero gravity (as in Baboo!) + Zangi hard drop = land and lock,
    instead of just sit there
  * Option to use classic (Game Boy style) or step-reset (TGM style)
    lockdown instead of move-reset (SRS style) lockdown.
  * Contains connection tables for all pieces.  Not used yet,
    but will be used for Cascade (where gravity is based on shapes
    of pieces), Square (which forms big squares only out of whole
    tetrominoes), and Bombliss (which doesn't place a bomb in a block
    that has blocks on opposite sides of it within the piece, such as
    the middle of an I, J, L, or T).
  * Pieces can carry bomb blocks within them.  Not used yet,
    but will be used for Bombliss.
  * Option for sticky gravity.  This will also be used for Bombliss.
  * Options rearranged: game on top, control in middle,
    view on bottom.
  * Options menu uses a smaller font and scrolls if necessary (but
    it's not necessary just yet).
  * Zero isn't wider than other digits in the large or small font.
  * Split debrief screen into debrief.c.
  * Debrief displays lockdown and line clear gravity type.
  * List of options in debrief is written with smaller font.
  * Config screen does a better job of ignoring simultaneous presses
    on USB joystick adapters that map the Control Pad to both axes
    and buttons (such as EMS USB2).
  * Main menu and options always respond to the arrow keys (in
    addition to the keys set in Game Keys), allowing players to
    reset Game Keys even when the keys have become corrupted.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.11 (2006-08-01):
  * Added Instant, 20 Hz, 15 Hz, and 12 Hz sideways speeds.
  * Added randomizer History 6 Rolls, very similar to Move to Back
    but sometimes repeating recent tetrominoes.
  * Allows separate wall kick tables for clockwise and anticlockwise
    rotation.

    rotation system's initial orientations for new pieces, next
    pieces, and the hold piece.

  * Option for ignoring diagonal presses.
  * Option for locking or not when using hard drop (Up).
  * Option to turn off smooth gravity animation.

0.10 (2006-07-27):
  * Set default full screen color depth to 16-bit which may be more
    compatible than 15-bit.
  * Press Print Screen to save the current screen as ljsnap.bmp.
  * Plays next piece sound whenever the next column moves up.
    0.08-0.09 didn't do so for the first hold in a game.
  * No longer tries rotating right when rotating left fails.
  * Handles DirectDraw amnesia (screen corruption in Alt+Tab)
    correctly in menu, game play, and debrief screens.
  * Asset and video buffer cleanup consolidated into one function.
  * Gravity speeds up 50% faster.
  * Added options menu for selecting sideways movement speed and
    randomizer.
  * Added more randomizers: 14-piece bag, move-to-back (TGM style),
    memoryless (classic), and SZSZ (used in the well-known proof
    that memoryless cannot be played indefinitely).
  * Debrief screen displays date and time of report generation as
    well as randomizer and sideways speed, and logs what it displays
    to lj-scores.txt.
  * Moved all gimmick-specific code from lj.c to new file gimmicks.c.
  * Built against Allegro 4.2.0.  (Users of previous versions will
    need the new DLL.)
  * Countdown based gimmicks (40 lines, 180 seconds, Baboo!,
    TGM World, Drill 40) use the same countdown variable for
    end state detection that they had used for countdown sound.
  * Support for tracked music using DUMB.
  * Manual is HTML.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.09 (2006-07-16):
  * Reverted sideways kicks of I tetromino rotating from horizontal
    to vertical based on testing I-I interactions in Tetris DS.
  * Key pretending is more consistent.
  * TGM World stops at 290 lines, more like Tetris The Grand Master.
  * In gimmicks with ARE (currently TGM World), allows initial
    hard drop.
  * Licensed as free software under GNU General Public License.
  * Fixed incomplete first bag (0.08 regression).
  * Has its own icon instead of the wall kick editor's icon.
  * No double initial rotation when using initial hold in TGM World.
  * Input actions are a 32-bit record for future recording.
  * Hidden next piece is a separate variable, which next piece
    sound also respects, fixing Items.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.08 (2006-07-08):
  * Plays sounds for the next piece like TGM.
  * No longer allows 800x552 window now that 0.08 displays the
    gimmick name.
  * Supports spawn delay and line delay.
  * Supports initial hold and rotation.
  * Supports variable garbage randomness.
  * Begun to move gimmick code out of core.
  * Added TGM World gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except there's a half-second delay before each
    tetromino, and a half-second delay after each tetromino that
    forms at least one line. So if you want fast play, make more
    lines at once.
  * Added Drill 40 gimmick: 
    Like 40 lines, but the screen starts with 18 rows of garbage.
    Be prepared to rely on SRS infinite spin for the first few
    lines until your skill improves.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.07 (2006-06-30):
  * Added Baboo gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except there is no gravity, and the game
    ends after 300 keypresses.
  * Cleaned up the font a bit.
  * Corrected wall kicks for I tetromino to match an updated
    description provided by nicholas.  Specifically, I tetromino
    prefers kick-down to kick-up.
  * Removed sound-not-found debug message.
  * Plays "ready, go!" like TGM.
  * Bigger font for lines and time.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.06 (2006-06-25):
  * Gimmicks are sorted into columns.
  * Debrief responds to controller mapping.
  * Debrief shows keypresses per tetromino and garbage per minute.
  * Loads/saves vkey configuration from/to disk instead of
    prompting the user every time the program starts.
  * Build system switched to GNU Make.
  * Terminal window ("DOS box") hidden.
  * Responds to window system's close button.
  * Counts down 5-4-3-2-1 in line or time limited gimmicks.
  * Icon in the top left corner of the window is customized.
  * Displays ljbg.jpg in the window's blank space.
  * Displays blocks from ljblocks.bmp.
  * Releases the CPU for 5ms per frame when possible, so that
    background tasks such as a music player can keep up.
  * Increased sound effects' volume so that music players do not
    completely overpower them.
  * Added macros for rotate twice, move far left, and move far right.
  * Corrected fix to alternation between falling and landed states
    that occurred especially when sliding a tetromino to the right
    under high gravity.
  * Added Items gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except after the first 7 pieces you get
    random starting orientations, no rotation, and hidden next
    pieces, and the speed goes to 1G.  Every time you are given an
    I piece, either you get 2 lines of garbage or the columns of
    blocks in the well are shuffled.
  * Fixed scoring tables in README.txt.

_____________________________________________________________________

0.04 (2006-06-22):
  * Uses an OS-native bitmap rather than an Allegro bitmap,
    which may allow faster drawing with some video cards.
  * Allows play from a keyboard or a joystick.
  * Presents a key configuration screen when the program starts.
  * A 500ms delay after the game ends. Drama will come soon to this
    space.

_____________________________________________________________________
0.03 (2006-06-21):
  * Debriefing responds only to Esc, Enter, and keypad Enter.
  * Compensates for refresh rates other than 60 Hz.
  * Change log included with program.
  * Plays sound effects for shift, rotate, land, lock, line, b2b.
  * Bigger text using the "Aver" font.
  * Lock delay in Marathon decreases gradually after gravity
    surpasses 20G.
  * Reads keys through a bitfield, allowing for custom key->vkey
    bindings to be implemented in the future.
  * (Internal) Does not alternate between "falling" and "landed"
    states when resetting lock delay on slide.

_____________________________________________________________________

    20G, and if you fall below the minimum PPM, it automatically
    locks the tetromino, and the minimum PPM increases by 10 every
    64 tetrominoes.
  * Debriefing computes PPM and score.
  * Debriefing returns to gimmick selection instead of exiting
    the program.

_____________________________________________________________________

  * initial release
  * full SRS implemented
  * 7-piece bag randomizer
