Future:
  * Dual Marathon gimmick:
    The keys control both a platform game (in the top window) and
    standard S.M.G. (in the bottom window).  If you die on either
    window, you lose.
  * Ridin' Spinners gimmick:
    Standard S.M.G., except if you abuse lock delay, or you make a
    T-spin triple, the music changes to a cover of "Ridin' Spinners"
    by Three 6 Mafia for a few seconds, and the screen spins (as in
    TOD). 
  * Wi-Fi Items gimmick:
    3/4 of the time you start it, it will play annoying music for
    two minutes, give an 86420 error, and quit. The rest of the
    time, it will play annoying music for between 15 seconds and
    two minutes and then switch to Vs. w/ Items gimmick.
  * Expand pcjoy: two players, two pkeys per vkey per player
  * Two-player modes
  * Compose synchronized music for Rhythm mode
  * H&R Blocks scoring method:
    First spotted in freepuzzlearena Tetanus.  Each piece is either
    entirely dark or entirely light.  A line of all dark or all light
    scores as 2 lines.  Score for n lines is n*(n+1)*50.
  * Store and display assertion text
  * Change wall kick tables from set of arrays to array of structs,
    where each struct represents a rotation system.
  * Low res version for recording using free version of camstudio.

  * Editable option presets
    The game keeps a list of named presets.  Each preset has a list
    of options with a checkbox by each option's name.  If the box is
    checked, the checkbox value overrides the base option value.
    Player can choose two presets before playing; generally, these
    will be a rotation system and a rule set (seconded by Needle,
    kotetsu213, and jujube)
